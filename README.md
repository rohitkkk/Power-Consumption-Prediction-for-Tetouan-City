# Power-Consumption-Prediction-for-Tetouan-City
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict power consumption across three distribution zones in Tetouan City, Morocco. The model employs a Random Forest regression algorithm to forecast energy consumption based on environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.
